#0x05. AirBnB clone - RESTful API
The 0x05. AirBnB clone - RESTful API project is a continuation of the AirBnB clone series, focusing on building a RESTful API for web application. This API allows interaction with the application's backend through HTTP requests. Below, all explain the project and its key components in detail:

#What is a RESTful API?
A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol? typically HTTP. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.
Project Structure
Setup and Initialization:

Create Flask Application: Use the Flask framework to create a web application that will serve your RESTful API.
Configure Flask: Set up the necessary configurations and environment settings for Flask.
Routes and Views:

Define Routes: Create routes (endpoints) in Flask for handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Views: Define the logic for handling requests and responses for each route.
Models and Storage:

Models: Define the data models representing the resources in your application (e.g., User, Place, State, City).
Storage: Implement storage mechanisms (e.g., file storage, database) to persist data.
Serialization and Deserialization:

Serialization: Convert Python objects (models) to JSON format for API responses.
Deserialization: Convert JSON data from requests into Python objects.
Error Handling:

Define Error Handlers: Create custom error handlers to provide meaningful error messages and status codes for different types of errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request).
Testing:

Unit Tests: Write unit tests to ensure that your API endpoints and business logic work correctly.
Integration Tests: Write integration tests to test the interaction between different components of your API.
